# Architect a Blockchain Solution for Drug Supply Chain

## Introduction

One of the biggest challenges with supply chains is the lack of transparency in product tracking which leads to increased costs, counterfeit goods, and unnecessary waste. From the food on our table to the luxury handbags on store shelves - how can we trust the products we buy?

## Blockchain - The solution

A Blockchain-based supply chain management solution can provide more accurate tracking, helping reduce fraud by transparently tracking product origination.

## Drug Supply Chain

The pharmaceutical industry has a particularly complex supply chain, with many varied stakeholders involved in the manufacture and distribution of a single drug. Blockchain offers an opportunity to simplify the process and enable quality control throughout the supply chain.

## How it works ?

Drug supply chain solution involves using Blockchain for tracking the authenticity of the drug, starting from the manufacturer via the distributor to the pharmacist. It ensures that the pharmacist receives the original drug without the drug entering the gray market.
